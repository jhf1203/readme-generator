### Description
      
This application generates a readMe that meets quality guidelines, is simple enough to be used by a beginner, and detailed enough to be used by a seasoned professional.

There are a couple of concepts behind why an application like this is so important.
- Consistency.  Using this generator for each application created creates predictibility and ease of use and navigation should someone want to read your documentation for multiple projects/repos.
- Simplicity.  By answering prompts and having sections auto-populate there is an efficiency created that isn't present if a readMe is generatred from scratch.  

This generator uses the command line interface through Node, and is able to be easily added to any repo to take care of the documentation portion of the project.

### Instructions
  
This generator is intended to be used with every project a user would put forward.  The easiest way to do this is to ensure a copy is saved locally so it can be transferred to the local folder for the repo in which the user is currently working:

1.  Clone the repo for readme-generator using your preferred method
2.  Save it locally in a folder that's easy to access, where you normally house other projects as well.
3.  Each time you begin a new project, copy the contents of the "develop" folder, and paste into your active repo (renaming "develop" to your preference)
4.  The generator will be housed in your current repo for use when you get to the readMe portion of your project.

Please keep in mind that by default the readMe that you generate will save within what's currently named "develop."  Different users have different preferences and methods of organization, so the readMe can be easily moved to a different directory of your choice once it's been generated.

### Usage
  
The intent of this generator is to make the usage as straightforward as possible.

1.  Ensure you install the "inquirer" package via Node prior to running this generator
2.  Once you're ready to generate the readMe, open a terminal window in your application and type "node index.js"  "index.js" can be substituted for a different file name should you choose to rename it.
3.  Answer the prompts as they populate on your console.  Some will require you to enter text directly into the prompt, some will provide a list of options from which to choose, some will open a text editor window, to support line and paragraph breaks for longer sections as well as any markdown you choose to add.  
4.  Once you have answered all of the prompts, you should see an .md file populate within the develop folder.
5.  Should you wish to add anything additional (screenshots, gifs, etc) that were not inserted earlier you may modify the readMe as needed.  However, it's designed to require minimum customization/additions.

If there's any functionality/step that you would like to see modified, feel free to share using the collaborate link you see in this page.
